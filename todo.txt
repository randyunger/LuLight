New TODOs:

Faster page load
    Don't query state every page load. (Permacache fullstate)

One slider for all lights in filter?
configurable filters- checkbox to control which filters assoc w slider
Mqtt disconnects server side
Timing issues - slow action from lutron?
LED under cabinets - not dimmable.
