New TODOs:
- Should setup DNS on rpi to resolve naming issue permanently. Not every client is running mDNS.
- Not working with Alexa
- Not loading state right initially on rpi, but is loading properly on localhost?!

----
Faster page load
    Don't query state every page load. (Permacache fullstate)

One slider for all lights in filter?
configurable filters- checkbox to control which filters assoc w slider
Mqtt disconnects server side
Timing issues - slow action from lutron?
LED under cabinets - not dimmable.

-----------------------
Done!
-----------------------
- Page loads with sliders in right position
- Presets
- Update sliders when state changes via switches
- Push notification to web page
    - MQTT
